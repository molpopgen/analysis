.SH NAME
sharedPoly \- calculate the number of shared, private, and fixed polymorphisms between 2 partitions of aligned sequence data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sharedPoly -i <infile> -n <sample size of partition 1>
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsharedPoly\fP outputs the number of shared, private, and fixed differences between 2 partitions of aligned sequence data.  This may be useful if data are sampled from 2 populations or duplicated genes.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
\fBsharedPoly\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-i <infile>
specify a file containing aligned sequences in FASTA format to analyze
.TP
.B \-h <infile>
specify a file containing a polymorphism table in a spreadsheet format
.TP
.B \-n <nsam1> 
nsam1 is the number of sequences in the first partition.  For example, if there are 10 sequences in the file, 6 from population 1, and 4 from population 2, pass \-n 6 to the program.
.TP
.B \-b 
only consider bi-allelic sites in the alignment
.TP
.B \-v
verbose output
