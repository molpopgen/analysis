.SH NAME
descPoly \- a program to qualitatively describe features of polymorphism data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B descPoly -i <infile> -O <outgroup>
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdescPoly\fP prevides a description of sequence polymorphism data.  The main purpose of the program is to describe "oddities" that are normally ignored in analysis.  These include: sites with multiple hits, gaps, SNPs over gaps, and sites with missing data.

.SH OPTIONS
\fBdescPoly\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-i <infile>
specify a file containing aligned sequences in FASTA format to analyze
.TP
.B \-O <outgroup> 
specify the outgroup sequence in the data.  The value should be from 1 to n, where n is the total number of sequences in the file
