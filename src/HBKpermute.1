.SH NAME
HBKpermute \- a program to perform the permutation tests for population substructure described by Hudson, Boos, and Kaplan (1992) Mol. Biol. Evol. 9:138-151. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B GSL_RNG_SEED=<seed> HBKpermute -i <infile> -c <config>
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBHBKpermute\fP performs a test for population substructure by permuting the population assigments of the sequences in a datafile and calculating a statistic representing the degree of structure observed in the data.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
\fBHBKpermute\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-i <infile>
specify a file containing aligned sequences in FASTA format to analyze
.TP
.B \-c <npop> <config>
<config> is a list of numbers representing the sample sizes in each population in the infile, in the order they appear in the infile.
.TP
.B \-O <outgroup>
<outgroup> is the index (i.e., counting from zero) of the outgroup sequence in the data, if present
.TP
.B \-n <nperms>
number of permutations to run
.TP
.B \-s weight populations by sample size, otherwise they will be weighted equally
